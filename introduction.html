                is a 2009 multiplayer online battle arena video game developed 
                and published by Riot Games. Inspired by Defense of the Ancients, 
                a custom map for Warcraft III, Riot's founders sought to develop a 
                stand-alone game in the same genre. Since its release in October 2009, 
                League has been free-to-play and is monetized through purchasable 
                character customization. The game is available for Microsoft Windows 
                and macOS.</p> </td>
